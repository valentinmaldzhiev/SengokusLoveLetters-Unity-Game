# SengokusLoveLetters-Unity-Game
This is a Unity project for my final year of university. I created a video game about Samurai, Japanese History and Culture.
I used Unity Collab to work with a Sound Designer, but since Unity want to remove Collaborate as an option, I decided to transfer my project in GitHub and continue working with my Sound Designer from here.
